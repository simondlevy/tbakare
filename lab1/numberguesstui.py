This program plays a guessing game with the user.  The program
displays a greeting and thinks of a number between 1 and 100.
The user inputs guesses until a guess equals the number.

Usage on command line (default limits are 1 and 100):

python3 numberguesstui.py

python3 numberguesstui.py 50 100

Usage in IDLE (default limits are 1 and 100):

main()

main(50, 100)
